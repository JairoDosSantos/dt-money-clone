## About The Project

>This project was created in order to challenge me to practice more about Next.js and TailwindCss. The idea to make this project came through a project developed by Diego Fernandes diego3g CTO from RocketSeat (using ReactJS and StyledComent).

Here's why:

* To improve my skills with tailwindCss;
* Learn how to use NextAuth;
* Create something that people can come to use in their daily lives :smile:
